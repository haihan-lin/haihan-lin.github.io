  description: I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Utah, focusing in Data Visualizations and Human-Computer Interactions. For my research, I work with domain scientists (physicians, psychiatrists, etc) and build customized visualization tools to help them explore their data. My thesis focuses on formalizing the knowledge about data and building tools that help domain experts to externalize and share their knowledge about the data.

  description: I got my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from Macalester College, a liberal arts college in Saint Paul, MN. Besides getting a killer GPA and graduating with summa cum laude, I received 2nd place with fellow students in our Hackathon competition. We extended our Hackathon project to a start-up project, SaveryEats. Even though it did not end up in places, it was a great experience trying to start a business from zero.
