# UPDB Social Timelines

**This project is under active development**

Visual Design Lab is collaborating with population scientists at Utah Population Database. They are exploring how the structure of one's social network (joining or leaving the family, moving, passing away) can affect one's length of life. We are developing an interactive data visualization application for them to explore social networks at scale.
